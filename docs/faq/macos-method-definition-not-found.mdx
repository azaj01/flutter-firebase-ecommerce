# macOS warning: method definition not found

While running the project on macOS, you may encounter a series of warnings like this:

```
/Users/andrea/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/firebase_auth-4.19.5/macos/Classes/FLTPhoneNumberVerificationStreamHandler.m:8:17: warning: method definition for 'initWithAuth:arguments:' not found [-Wincomplete-implementation]
@implementation FLTPhoneNumberVerificationStreamHandler {
                ^
In file included from /Users/andrea/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/firebase_auth-4.19.5/macos/Classes/FLTPhoneNumberVerificationStreamHandler.m:5:
- (instancetype)initWithAuth:(FIRAuth *)auth arguments:(NSDictionary *)arguments;
^
1 warning generated.
```

From what I can see, these do not affect the app and can be safely ignored.
