# Xcode 15 build warnings on macOS (DVTAssertions)

When building the Flutter app for macOS on Xcode 15, you're likely to encounter these build warnings:

- [[MacOS] build Warning : xcodebuild[34980:372023] [MT] DVTAssertions](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/135277)

However, these are just warnings and the app should still build.
