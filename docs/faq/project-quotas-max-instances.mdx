# Your current project quotas donâ€™t allow for the current max instances setting of 100

When deploying some of the 2nd-gen Cloud Functions, you may come across the error below. ðŸ‘‡

Your current project quotas donâ€™t allow for the current max instances setting of 100.
Either reduce this functionâ€™s maximum instances, or request a quota increase on the underlying Cloud Run service at https://cloud.google.com/run/quotas.
You can adjust the max instances value in your functionâ€™s runtime options:

```ts
setGlobalOptions({maxInstances: 10})
```

setGlobalOptions({ maxInstances: 10 });
```
